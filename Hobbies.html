          <p>I have Co-Founded <em>J&J Mendoza</em>, an iOS Development team with my colluage Josh Mendoza</p>
          <p>I became intrested in programming my Senior year of high school. With never taking a class of programming in my life,
            I managed to learn the basics of C++ and fell in love with it. Since then, I have taken Udemy courses from Angela Yu,
            an amazing instructor that I would recomment to anyone. She has taught me the ins and outs of iOS Development
            as well as Web Development. Matter of fact, this whole website I have built from scrartch using what she has taught me!</p>
